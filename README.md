## 🔍 Project Overview

This Chat DApp demonstrates a decentralized messaging application where:

- Users connect their wallets using MetaMask
- User accounts are stored on a blockchain via smart contracts
- Friend lists are managed on-chain
- Messages are exchanged and recorded securely through smart contract functions

This architecture ensures censorship resistance, transparency, and ownership of user data.
